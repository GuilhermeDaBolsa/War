# War (School Project)

War is a React Native App that replaces the dices used in War table game.

It gives the attacker as well as the defensor 3 dices.

You can mannualy roll any dice (it does nothing besides giving you a 1 - 6 random side of the dice).
Or you can enter a battle. In a battle all the 6 dices are rolled and then the values are compared as so:

  - the attacker's greater dice with the defensor's greater dice
  - the attacker's 'medium' dice with the defensor's 'medium' dice
  - the attacker's smallest dice with the defensor's smallest dice

The defensor's win if his dice is greater or equals the attacker's dice, otherwise the attacker win.

For each step of the battle that you lose, you also lose an army.
The app shows the battle result illustrating the number of armies each one lost.
